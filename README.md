This project is in progress.

Descriptions:

In this project, I am creating a 2D zombie evade game. At this point in the project, I am developing the zombie enemy AI. 

Progress:

Features:

-The zombie will charge the player if the player is seen. When the player is not seen, the zombie walks back and forth along a path. 

Bugs:

-The zombie can see through the walls. I am investigating how the walls are generated in the pygame library to determine how to fix the bug.
